    Prior to learning selenium we should know Java

    Q. Why we need to learn java before learning the Selenium?
    Ans:
    - 1) who developed java?
        - company name was sun micro systems and letter it got acquired by Oracle

     Selenium with Java is developed with JDK so to understand the concepts in selenium we have to know java
     that's why there is necessity to learn JAVA before learning the selenium


     -- Pre-requisite for Selenium --

     1. revise String class and its methods
     2. revise OPP's Concept (class, Object, Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation, polymorphism)
     3. Method Overloading
     4. Method Overriding
     5. Conditions(if, if else, switch)
     6. Loop(for, while, di while, for each)
     7. Constructor(default and parameterize constructor)
     8. Exception (CE, UCE, Try catch, throws, finally)
     9. Collection
     10. up-casting
     11. down-casting
     12. Interface

     Q : what is System.out.println()
        What is System?
           - System is class which is present in java.lang package
           - for example :
             package  java.lang
             class System {

             }

        WHat is out?
            - out is a static variable which is of type printStream
            - for example :
               package  java.lang
             class System {

                static PrintStream out;

             }

        WHat is println()?
            - Println() is a overloaded method which is present in printstream class
            - for example :

            class PrintStream {

            public void println(String s){
            }
            public void println(int s){
            }
            public void println(long s){
            }
            public void println(char s){
            }
            }

     you need to start : Code Optimization

     What is code Optimization ?
     Reducing the no of statement of code but still getting the same output called as code optimization


     Method Chaining :
     calling one method using another method is called as method chaining

     Generic Methods:
     - Generic methods are the resuable methods which contains the common statemets
     which are present in multiple places


     VERY VERY IMPORTANT NOTE
     WE SHOULD NOT HARDCODE ANY VALUES IN GENERIC METHOD


        write down the generic methods for following
        1. Substraction
        2. Multiplication
        3. Division
        4. count the length of String
        5. reverse the String
        6. Count the occurance od each character in string
            for ex : vitthal
            o/p : v = 1, i =1, t = 2, h = 1, a=1, l = 1
