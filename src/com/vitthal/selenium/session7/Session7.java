    --- What is Web elements ---

    - Anythig which is present on the webpage is called as web elements
      ex : links, text fields, buttons, dropdown, etc

    - ehese elements are developed by using HTML language
      (HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language)

      What are all components of HTML
       1. Tags
       2. Attributes
       3. Text

       Syntax of HTML

       <tag  Attribute=AttrubuteValue> Text </tag >


       Tags : Tags are used to define the type of the elements
       suc as listbox, textfields, links, buttons etc

       ex : input, htmlhead, etc

       Tags will be enclosed within the angular braces

       Attributes :

       ex : id, name, class, href

       each and every attribute will be having its own value

      Anything which is present in between opening tag and closing tag is called as text

      We can also develop webpages by using notepad

      2. write the HTML code
      3. save with .html extension

      CSS : is the language we use to style an HTML document

      synxtax :
      tag {
        style atrtibute : style value
      }
      tag willbe  : body/your html tags also/ html attributes also

      if your attribute is class
      shortcut .
      if your attribuye is id
      shortcut is #

      for ex
      <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/" class="forgotpass"> Forgot Password? </a>
      i need to add red color to this link
      my css would be

      .forgotpass {
              color:red;
           }
