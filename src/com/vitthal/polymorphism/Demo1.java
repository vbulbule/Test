    /*
    Polymorphism :
     - implies one method performing same/similar task based on the different context
     as in terms of method overloading
     for ex : add(int a, int b)
              add(int a, int b, int c)

     or performing redefined tasks or enhanced task (in case of method overriding)

     polymorphish can be classified into
     1 : Static/ compile time polymorphism : method overloading
     2 : dynamic/ Runtime polymorphism : method overriding
         in Dynamic poly : when the overriden method is called through the reference variable of the balse class
         then JVM determines which method
         needs to be invoked


         Static binding : when a method is associated to the object/class during complition it is called static binding
         ex : private, final and static methods

         Dynamic binding : when a method is associated to the object during execution it is called dynamic binding
         ex : overriden method & upcasting
              (calling overriden method)
